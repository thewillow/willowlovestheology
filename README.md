## About WLT  

**Willow Loves Theology!** is a non-sectarian and interfaith ministry with a mission to educate the curious public, religious and non-adherents alike, about the important contributions theology has made to our cultures, society, politics, and civilizations.  

At Willow Loves Theology!, you will gain an understanding of the diverse landscape of religious beliefs in North America (and beyond!) and how theology affects your everyday lives, such as our cultures, interpersonal relationship, unspoken social assumptions, and political discourse. The mission of WLT is to make theology understandable, relevant, and accessible to people who are outside of seminaries and church conventions, and to offer it in a size you can read in one sitting.
